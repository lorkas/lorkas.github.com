# Editing lorkas.github.com

### Option 1:

Edit the index.md file. It uses [Github flavored](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#hr) as a formatting syntax.

This page was made using [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/). See their page for documentation. You need to have [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed with [ruby's Gem package manager](http://rubygems.org/) to run it locally. The page will be automatically generated when you push it to github, though, so if you don't care run it locally, that's fine.

### Option 2:

Email Brent with your changes.
