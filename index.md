# Submission guidelines
We are working on a set of guidelines for pieces we will accept. So far they are as follows:
### Works must be free and cross-platform.
We have members with Macbooks, Windows, and Linux laptops, and we need to accommodate everyone as well as possible.
Also, we don't want to require our members to pay for software, especially with the proliferation of good, free multimedia software.

### Make installing the software easy
Or at least try! Not all of our members have a lot of experience with installing development environments, so the simpler the process is, the easier it is for all of us.

That being said, making installation smooth can be rough, and we don't demand that you do. If it will be a more complext install, we'll need an installation / testing day for your work. Please let us know and we'll help arrange that.

### Test your piece
We want to make sure that everyone can play during the performance. It's no fun if you get on stage and the software crashes before the performance starts. Again, if you need to test, we can accomodate!

### Aesthetics
Submitted works need to fit the laptop orchestra aesthetic. Some aspects of this are
- The interaction between the performers and the laptop.
  The laptops are the instruments. We can (and do!) use other interfaces, but the role of the laptop should be essential. Don't, for example, hand everyone midi keyboards and sheet music.

- We have a wide range of musical abilities, from novice to professional. Everyone should be able to participate.

- There should be risk and skill involved.
  Some of us are novices, but the piece should still be engaging to play. If it could be preformed by a [shell script](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/374d/), why are people involved?

- It must push the established norms of music in some way. We're not looking for midi-based pop music or [chiptunes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune).

These rules can be fuzzy though - for example, we do welcome live, acoustic instruments, either as computer interfaces or as part of the orchestra/ As with all the guidelines, if you're unsure about something, please talk to us!

# Tools
The following are some tools you can use to create laptop orchestra pieces. The ones we know LOrkAS members have used are marked with a +.

### Audio
- **[SuperCollider](supercollider.sourceforge.net)** +  
  SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. It is very powerful, but can be difficult to use.
- **[Overtone](overtone.github.com)**  
  Audio programming environment using [Clojure](clojure.org), a lisp dialect that runs on the [JVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine), using the SuperCollider audio engine.
- **[CLM](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/clm.html)**  
  A sound synthesis package from the Stanford CCRMA lab. Code audio using Common Lisp, Scheme, C, Ruby, or Forth.
- **[Max](http://cycling74.com/products/max/)** +  
  A graphical programming environment for creating interactive, multimedia works. While the software itself is expensive, there is a [Max runtime](http://cycling74.com/downloads/runtime/) that will run a max file on OS X or Windows. It does not, however, work on Linux, and some of our members have linux laptops, so please consider that before using Max.
- **[Pure Data](http://puredata.info/)** +  
  A free, open-source, more cross-platform version of Max. Some Max plugins work with PD, but many do not. Max is easier to use, PD is free to use.

### Graphical
- **[Processing](processing.org)** +  
  A popular Java programming environment for creating live visual sketches. Quick and easy to use for small projects. There are many plugins for Processing, a [SuperCollider](http://www.erase.net/projects/processing-sc/) adapter. If you want to set it up in [Eclipse](www.eclipse.org) and need help, we can help you get started. 
- **[Cinder](http://libcinder.org/)** +  
  A creative coding library for C++. It's similar to Processing, but in C++. More difficult if you haven't done programming before, but more faster and more powerful if you have.
- **[Jitter](http://cycling74.com/products/max/video-jitter/)** +  
  Video and graphics for Max.
